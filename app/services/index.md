intro: The 2017 Index ranks 22 telecommunications, and internet and mobile companies on their public commitments and disclosed policies affecting usersâ€™ freedom of expression and privacy. For each company, we selected up to four services to evaluate. For telecommunications companies, we evaluate pre- and post-paid mobile, and in most cases (when offered by the company) fixed-line broadband services.
